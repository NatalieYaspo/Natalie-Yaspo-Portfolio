## Usage

When the user loads the portfolio, they are presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.

When they view the header, they are presented with my name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.

When the user views the navigation titles, they presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.


When a navigation title is selected, the browser URL changes and the user is presented with the corresponding section below the navigation and that title is highlighted.

When the portfolio load the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default.

The About Me section contains a recent photo or avatar of me along with a short bio.

The Portfolio section shows titled images of six of my applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.

The Contact section has a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.

If the user moves their cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, they receive a notification that this field is required.

When the user enters text into the email address field, they receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.

The Resume section contains a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developerâ€™s proficiencies.

The footer contains links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles.
